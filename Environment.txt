13 Environment

13.1 Sustainability (freedom for later generations)

The Pirate Party stands for sustainability. Therefore we want to ensure that the basis for a dignified, free existence also exists in the future. One prerequisite is a transparent, responsible use of natural resources.

13.2 Livable environment (protecting livelihoods)

We want to sustain a healthy, natural environment. This means a reduction of pollutants released into our environment and the protection and re-establishment of natural areas, particularly those with high biodiversity.

13.3 Use of resources

We demand a responsible use of resources. Fossil and regenerative resources must be used sustainably. In order to sustain opportunities for upcoming generations, generative resources must be used on a large scale and replace, where possible, fossil and regenerative resources.

13.4 Energy policy

We want an energy infrastructure which protects the environment and is safe in the long run. This means a change from fossil energy sources to generative and regenerative sources. Regenerative resources must be used under the condition of sustainability and must not compete with other environmental goals. In addition, we want a transparent, decentralized producer structure. Only this way can we guarantee participation of all citizens and prevent monopolies.
