17 Protection of whistleblowers 

17.1 Preamble

It needs to become entrenched in the public conscience that whistleblowing is a form of moral courage which needs to be supported and protected. Journalistic sources are already considered valuable today. To us, whistleblowers are people who publicize violations and illegal activity, such as corruption, insider trading or general hazards they witnesses at their workplace, during medical treatments, or on other occasions.

17.2 Protection of whistleblowers

The Massachusetts Pirate Party understands that whistleblowers have an important corrective function in every free, democratic society. This requires, on one hand, the development of a general legal provision for the protection of whistleblowers. On the other hand, so- ciety must be informed that whistleblowers fulfill an important social function; for press informers, this is already established in the public conscience. The Massachusetts Pirate Party also rejects any separation into "good änd "bad" whistleblowers. The evaluation of whistleblowing cannot and must not depend on any country’s particular interest. The Massachusetts Pirate Party supports an urgently needed general legal provision for the pro- tection of whistleblowers. The current whistleblowing legislation passed by the Supreme Court and the Federal Labor Court is not comprehensible to laymen.


This creates significant legal uncertainty. Therefore, every whistleblower is exposed to incalculable risks under criminal and civil law. This requires that lawmakers give up the previous procedure of protecting individual legal areas and instead codify general and comprehensive protection for whistleblowers, including the necessary exemptions.
