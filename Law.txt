18 Law

We reject the erosion of the right to a proper jurisdiction by phenomena such as „forum shopping“ or „itinerant tribunal“. Claimants must not be able to take an issue to court wherever they expect to have the best chances. Since legislation allows for the assumption that, when dealing with online publications, the place of effect can be any place the content can be accessed, the concept of jurisdiction at the place of effect is no longer up to date and allows people to choose courts arbitrarily. We want to clearly regulate which court is responsible for the resolution of a legal dispute.
